# Competences
Web app that helps to track people's competences

User should have an ability to login, add competences to his profile, create new ones, edit profile bio, pics and stuff, and track other people's competences.

### Frameworks, libs and patterns
Uses ASP.NET, Entity Framework, CQRS(MediatR), JWT, AutoMapper, Clean Architecture for API.

React, Typescript, Mobx, Axios, Formik and other stuff for client.

### ToDo:
  1)Add pics to competences
  
  2)Add paging, sorting and filtering for competences
  
  3)Add Tasks??(Task may contain multiple competences, users can be assigned to tasks based on their knowledge level, maybe add suggesting best user for a task)
  
  4)Add postgres/ms sql or smth for db
  
  5)Maybe add google/facebook/etc login
